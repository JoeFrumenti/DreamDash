Game Devs: Joe Frumenti, Hannah Wigh, and Sam Tancio
Date completed: 5/1/2022 (except we are going to keep working on it so not really)

Theres a lot of technically interesting things in here, but to keep it short,
we implemented some trignonometry/geometry to make pathing for the enemy ghosts. 
There is also some linear algebra/newtonian physics/vector math stuff going on in the player's movement, which
we used to make the player glide with a set variable used for accelleration. The game was also made in Unity,
which is much more technically difficult to use than Phaser but has a lot more capabilities
